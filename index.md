**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered so far in the LLM Guardrails domain has been learning about jailbreaking LLM-controlled robots. Normally when I think about LLM guardrails, I think of chatbots and how they should not give any wrong or "bad" information. But actually being able to change the controls of robots is a much more tangible effect of the LLMs, and honestly needs more attention when it comes to guardrails.
