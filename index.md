**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**\
The most interesting topic covered so far in the LLM Guardrails domain has been learning about jailbreaking LLM-controlled robots. Normally when I think about LLM guardrails, I think of chatbots and how they should not give any wrong or "bad" information. But actually being able to change the controls of robots is a much more tangible effect of the LLMs, and honestly needs more attention when it comes to guardrails.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
Similarly to the most interesting topic question, it would be cool to see how we can protect user data from getting leaked in which the user can be physically affected if something is changed. For example, this could be biometric data from wearables getting leaked and then changed to make users think they have a different status than what it should be in reality.

**3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
